  <summary>Retro 2D platformer inspired by Infinite Mario (native SDL2 edition)</summary>
  <description>
    <p>
      Infinite Tux is a retro-style 2D platformer inspired by Infinite Mario.
      This edition is a C++ port of the original Java version, built on SDL2
      with full gamepad support.
    </p>
    <p>
      The game is procedurally generated every time it is replayed, so
      you always play a different game.
      You can break blocks, run fast, collect coins and get one-ups.
      Run through the levels stepping on enemies and spitting colorful
      spit balls to kill them. Carry de-hatched chick eggs and launch
      them towards other enemies to kill them too!
    </p>
    <p>
      Features include configurable keyboard and gamepad controls, multiple
      MIDI synthesizer backends, fullscreen mode, and user-customizable assets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Infinite Tux recreates the feel of those fun 1980's platformer games
      that kept people sitting in front of their CRT television sets for
      hours on end. Have fun and enjoy this 8-bit retro style game!
    </p>
